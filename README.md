# Fluent Python
This is my repo following the book "Fluent Python (2nd Edition)" by Luciano Ramalho.

Some reviews from the readers:

* Great book to become an upper intermediate python programmer. **If you are an absolute beginner, do not buy this book.** You will be very lost.
* This is the best python book I have ever read.
* This is an excellent book for learning how to use the Python language proficiently. It is written for experienced developers.
